              <span role="img">üëãüèª</span> Hi, I'm Long, but also go by Jack. I'm
              a senior at the University of Cincinnati. I'm pursuing a BS degree
              in Computer Science with an anticipated graduation in May 2025.
              I'm most passionate about solving real world problems, advocating
              sustainability, and building community-driven applications.
              <br />
              <br />
              <span role="img">‚ú®</span> I appreciate every challenge I came
              across that helped cultivate my self-efficacy in this risk-taking
              world. At STEAM for Vietnam, I have a chance to work with many
              great and talented people to delivery high-end computer science
              course to Vietnamese children. I learned the importance of staying
              open-minded to changes, whether to be adapted to new environment,
              programming languages, or attitudes. I feel motivated as I
              discover ways to improve flexibility and creative through ongoing
              discussions with others to address a customer's changing needs.
              <br />
              <br />
              <span role="img">‚õ±Ô∏è</span> I love cleaning and organize my
              workplace. I feel like if I can keep my work area clean, I can
              successfully do other things as well. I love reading and
              listening. I used to spend hours to read the History of Greek
              ~quite interesting indeed~. Coming to American, I found out that I
              actually enjoy cooking for my friends as it can help me to relieve
              stress from working and studying.
              <br />
              <br />
              <span role="img">üóΩ</span> What motivates me to get up and get
              ready for work is the knowledge that I have another opportunity to
              deliver love and camaraderie to my neighborhood. I thrive in
              occupations that promote variety and culture, and I appreciate
              working with people from all walks of life to achieve a common
              goal. Not only do I regard it as an opportunity to gain new
              knowledge, but also to connect profoundly with individuals through
              their diverse perspectives on situations. I strive to be a team
              player, to be aware of those around me's needs and desires, and to
              thrive on positive reinforcement.
